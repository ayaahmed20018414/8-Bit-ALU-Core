The ALU's operations are governed by four function inputs (S3 to S0), which direct the 8-bit
2-to-1 multiplexers both internally and externally within the logic blocks. It is required to
implement the ALU both in behavioral and structure methods and compare the results of the
two designs. The operations performed by the ALU, based on the select inputs, are detailed in
Table 1.
